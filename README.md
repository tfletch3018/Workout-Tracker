# Workout-Tracker

## Description
Provide a short description explaining the what, why, and how of your project. Use the following questions as a guide:
- The task was to create a workout tracker, given the front end code already in tact by creating a Mongo database with a Mongoose schema with routes handled by Express
- The app allows the user to create, view and manage daily workouts. The user is able to log multiple exercises and then return to update this information if desired
- This application gave me the opportunity to work with Mongo and gain an understanding of some of its advantages.  It is an excellent tool for managing a data structure that will evelove over time. It also provides a fully functional JavaScript environment for use wih a MongoDB.

## User Story

* As a user, I want to be able to view create and track daily workouts. I want to be able to log multiple exercises in a workout on a given day. I should also be able to track the name, type, weight, sets, reps, and duration of exercise. If the exercise is a cardio exercise, I should be able to track my distance traveled.

## Business Context
A consumer will reach their fitness goals more quickly when they track their workout progress.

## Acceptance Criteria
When the user loads the page, they should be given the option to create a new workout or continue with their last workout.
The user should be able to:
  * Add exercises to the most recent workout plan.
  * Add new exercises to a new workout plan.
  * View the combined weight of multiple exercises from the past seven workouts on the `stats` page.
  * View the total duration of each workout from the past seven workouts on the `stats` page.
